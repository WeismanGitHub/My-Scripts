# My Scripts
## This is a collection of scripts that I've written.

- <strong>Endless Typer:</strong> Super simple script to make it seem like I'm constantly typing in a Discord channel.
- <strong>Forward DMs Selfbot:</strong> A Discord selfbot to forward DMs from one account to another.
- <strong>Discord Mute Hotkeys:</strong> Some hotkeys to server mute users in a specific channel. (Windows) Run on startup by adding a shortcut to `discord-mute-hotkeys.vbs` to your startup folder.
- <strong>Remove Instagram Note:</strong> A userscript to remove someone's notes on Instagram.
